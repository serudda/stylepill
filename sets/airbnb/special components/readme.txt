Last Set: Airbnb special components
-----------------------------------

This set contains:
- Main Header: ma-header
- Dark Subnav: ma-subnav--dark
- User profile avatar: ma-avatar
- Special Search Box: ma-searchbox

Use:
Unfortunately this the last set of components of the Airbnb theme,
so we decided to add very special components: the main header of Airbnb Homepage,
all types of user profile avatar, and a very cute searchbox that is used by Airbnb
on its homepage.

To use each of theses components you simply have to add its respective
main class (e.g. .ma-header, .ma-subnav--dark, .ma-avatar, etc) each have their
own modifiers, which you can find in the html files.

This set is separated into 3 folders: avatar, header, and searchbox.
There's a folder called images, it's where we store the images used by
each of these components.
